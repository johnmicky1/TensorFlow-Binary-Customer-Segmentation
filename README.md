# TensorFlow-Binary-Customer-Segmentation
This project is a Real-Time Customer Classification Model built using TensorFlow/Keras.  Its primary function is to perform binary classification (New Customer: 0 vs. Existing Customer: 1) instantly upon customer sign-up or login. The model uses immediate, non-transactional featuresâ€”specifically time of day, device type, session duration.
